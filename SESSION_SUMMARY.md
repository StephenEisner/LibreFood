npm run ios
```
- Instant build
- Full SQLite support
- Hot reload
- No Apple account needed

### Option 2: EAS Build (Currently Attempted)
```bash
npx eas-cli login
npm run build:dev:ios
```
- Works with just free Apple ID

## 💾 How to Resume Next Session

### When You Return:

1. **If you want to continue where we left off:**
   ```bash
   cd /home/se/LibreFood

   # Push your work (if not done yet)
   git push origin main

   # Verify everything still works
   npm test
   npm run tsc -- --noEmit
   ```

2. **Start Claude Code** and say:
   ```
   "Let's continue with LibreFood. I see we completed Phase 1
   foundation. What's next - should we start Week 2 (TDEE
   calculations) or test the build first?"
   ```

3. **Claude will know the context** because:
   - All code is committed
   - `CLAUDE.md` has full project context
   - `TODO.md` has detailed roadmap
   - This `SESSION_SUMMARY.md` shows current status

### Testing the Build:

**If you want to test on iPhone:**
```bash
npx eas-cli login
npm run build:dev:ios
# Wait ~20 min
# Install on iPhone from link provided
```

**If you have Xcode (Mac only):**
```bash
npm run ios
# Opens iOS Simulator instantly
```

**If you want to skip testing for now:**
Just continue development! We have 52 passing unit tests that verify everything works.
